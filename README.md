## Description

This application was created as a coding quiz that will help users  enhance their knowledge about JavaScript! They can save their high scores and compare how they did previously. 

## Usage

The quiz is started once the "start" button is clicked on and the timer of 95 seconds starts. The quiz then presents four multiple choice questions which must be answered. If answered incorrectly, the quiz will let you know that it was answered incorrectly on the next question and 15 seconds will be deducted from the time. If the user gets all the questions wrong or they run out of time, the quiz will end with "Game Over". Once completed, the user can enter their initials, (which will be stored in localStorage) and the score of how many questions they answered correctly will display on the screen.
